      <app-testimonial reviewerName="Rachael" applicationName="Fun Banking">
        I work with special needs students and wanted to teach them how to
        manage their money through a reward program that resembled a bank, so
        that they can be ready for "the real world". I use it every day.

      <app-testimonial reviewerName="Jamie" applicationName="Fun Banking">
        I searched forever to find an application like this for our students ‚Äî I
        love it!

        made.
